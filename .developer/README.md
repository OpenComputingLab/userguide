# Developer notes

To include this guide in your own Github repository, run the command:

`git submodule add https://github.com/OpenComputingLab/userguide userguide`

I also enabled a global setting:

`git config --global submodule.recurse true`

in the hope that submodules might get updated automatically if they aren't by default (git/Githib docs really suck on trying to find out for sure...).
